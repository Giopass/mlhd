Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has become increasingly important in health care monitoring, fitness tracking, and assistive technologies. This study presents a comparison of deep learning architectures for multi-sensor accelerometry-based activity recognition. We evaluate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and hybrid CNN-LSTM models on a dataset containing synchronized accelerometer data from four body locations. Our methodology addresses critical challenges in time series classification including class imbalance, data leakage prevention, and over￾fitting mitigation. Results demonstrate that CNN architectures with appropriate regularization achieve optimal performance (75-82% accuracy) while maintaining computational efficiency
